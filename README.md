# Time-Domain Signal Denoising & Feature Enhancement (Python)

Practical time-domain DSP techniques for improving noisy signals and enhancing transient activity (useful for sensor and biomedical-style signals).

## Techniques
- Windowed mean smoothing (noise reduction)
- Median-based impulsive outlier suppression
- Teager–Kaiser Energy Operator (TKEO) for activity enhancement
- Baseline normalization + Z-score scaling

## Run in Colab
(added after notebook is pushed)

## Tools
Python, NumPy, Matplotlib
